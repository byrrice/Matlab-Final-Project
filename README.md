# Audial, our homegrown music player
This was a basic music player that Heather Hoden and I created for our MatLab final project. It can play music as well as play various tones/record you playing tones. Holds a special place due to being the first coding project I ever did. RIP Heather Hoden to never code again. 

# Instructions:

## Top Section: 
Enter .wav file.  To play the file as is, click play button.  To slow down or speed up the file, enter the factor by which the file is to be sped up or slowed down in the respective text box and hit speed up or slow down button.

## Middle Section: 
Type a frequency and a duration into the respective text boxes and click enter.  To add another tone to be played directly after this tone, backspace the old frequency and duration and type new ones and click enter. Repeat as many times as desired.  To playback tones, click play.  To clear the .txt file that the inputs were loaded into, click the clear button, which resets the data, allowing new frequencies and tones to be put in. Thus, you can repeat the above instructions as many times as you want to.

## Bottom Section: 
Click the Record button.  Click on a note or series of notes.  Press Play button to stop recording and begin playback. Do this however many times you wish. In addition to this, you can just hit the notes and have them playback without recording.
